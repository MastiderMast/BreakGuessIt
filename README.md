# BreakGuessIt
## Info
A small tool that counts up from a start to end number.
I developed it because there are many discords that giveaway nitro and other crap to the one who guesses the number first. 
A Selfbot is for me too dangerous! Therefore, I just let keys emulate have fun with it ^^

## Setup
1. Make sure you have the latest [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed
2. Start the install.bat
3. You can now run the script anytime with run.bat

If you need help open an issue :D

## Credits
If you want to contribute open a pull request (why would you do that .-.) or develop the script further but give me credits :)
